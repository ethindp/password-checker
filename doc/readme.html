<h1>Password Checker</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The password checker add-on allows users to utilize password
dictionaries and a password examination system to determine the strength
and crack-ability of their password. It utilizes the list of passwords
in the SecLists repository. Users are free to add new passwords if they
so desire. The password checker add-on also allows users to generate
highly secure passwords.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use this add-on:</p>

<ul>
<li>ctrl+shift+NVDA+Z allows you to check the strength of a password. Do
note that this unfortunately locks up NVDA for a period of time (I'm
not sure how to fix this). estimated periods of time are around 2-4
seconds, depending on the power of your computer and the amount of
memory you have.</li>
<li>ctrl+shift+NVDA+g allows you to generate a random password that
satisfies the requirements of a strong password:
<ul>
<li>Has 12 Characters, Minimum: You need to choose a password that's
long enough. There's no minimum password length everyone agrees
on, but you should generally go for passwords that are a minimum
of 12 to 14 characters in length. A longer password would be
even better.</li>
<li>Includes Numbers, Symbols, Capital Letters, and Lower-Case
Letters: Use a mix of different types of characters to make the
password harder to crack.</li>
<li>Isn't a Dictionary Word or Combination of Dictionary Words: Stay
away from obvious dictionary words and combinations of
dictionary words. Any word on its own is bad. Any combination of
a few words, especially if they're obvious, is also bad. For
example, "house" is a terrible password. "Red house" is also
very bad.</li>
<li>Doesn't Rely on Obvious Substitutions: Don't use common
substitutions, either - for example, "H0use" isn't strong just
because you've replaced an o with a 0. That's just obvious. Try
to mix it up - for example, "BigHouse$123" fits many of the
requirements here. It's 12 characters and includes upper-case
letters, lower-case letters, a symbol, and some numbers. But
it's fairly obvious - it's a dictionary phrase where each word
is capitalized properly. There's only a single symbol, all the
numbers are at the end, and they're in an easy order to guess.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By using the password checker menu in the tools menu, you can
reload, extend and unload the password list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Loading, unloading, and extending the password list</h2>

<p>To load the password list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to 'NVDA Menu->Tools->Password Checker->Load password list...'.</li>
</ul>

<p>To extend the password list:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, create a text file; any text file ending in .txt will do.</li>
<li>Add all your passwords, separated by newlines. An example of some of
the PINs loaded by the default password list is given below. Each
password is read as it is found; there is no priority or sorting
method performed. Be careful how many passwords you add, though -
adding too many to the list of all passwords you've got loaded can
very easily cause you to run out of memory or cause an unacceptable
delay in the password checking process.</li>
<li>Once you've added all your passwords to the text file, open the
'NVDA Menu->Tools->Password Checker->Extend password list...'
dialog and select the file you want to load.</li>
<li>And that's it! All your passwords are ready to go!</li>
</ul>

<p>To unload the password list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to 'NVDA Menu->Tools->Password Checker->Unload password
list...'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of a password file</h2>

<p>1234</p>

<p>1111</p>

<p>0000</p>

<p>1212</p>

<p>7777</p>

<p>Note: Don't use this list - it is already loaded by default!</p>

<h2>Checking passwords</h2>

<p>To check passwords, press ctrl+shift+NVDA+Z. This will open a dialog
that will ask you for your password. Enter it and hit OK. The password
system will check its password lists (called "password frequency lists")
and also check your password against various password analysis
algorithms. Your password will earn a score between 1 and 4, with 1
being the worst and 4 being the best. Try to get a 4 all the time!</p>

<p>The system will also do a direct comparison against the loaded password
list and your password. If your password happens to be found in the
loaded password list, the check is aborted immediately and you are
notified and warned to change your password immediately. It is highly
recommended that you follow this warning; using any of the passwords in
the loaded password list is considered very dangerous and opens you up
to password dictionary attacks. The lists this add-on comes with are
definitely free and open to the public, including hackers, so it would
not be hard for a hacker to get all these lists and crack your password
relatively quickly if it happens to be one of the passwords in these
lists.</p>

<p>Once the password analysis process is completed, a password strength
report will be generated and displayed as an HTML document. Read through
it carefully; all the data within is very important, though that is up
to debate when it comes to the termonology section (which is only there
for informative reasons). The same could go for the password checking
time, which is not necessarily accurate. The rest of the data - password
times and feedback - are very important and pay very close attention to
everything presented there.</p>

<p>When reading the password times, the term "innumerable" may be presented
to you. This indicates that the time to crack your password was so high
that the system was unable to determine an appropriate time unit
measurement without causing division errors (in other words, the time
was so high that cracking it would be impossible on clasical machines
and would only be breakable by quantum computing). If you see this for
all four scenarios, good job!</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Do not solely rely on this add-on as your 'security adviser'! It is not
designed for this purpose, and is not designed to give you 100-percent
perfect (or close to perfect) security advice! It is only designed to
help you secure your passwords. Do not neglect your security because
this add-on indicates your password is safe! Always employ alternative
security methods, such as multi-factor authentication.</p>

<h2>Generating secure passwords</h2>

<p>This add-on has the unique capability to allow you to generate a safe,
secure password that will pass all checks that this add-on gives. As an
example, the generated password <code>9k(:H#,&gt;8q4M</code> earned a score of 4.
(Another 2-character password, <code>m\</code>, naturally earned a score less than
4.) To do so, press ctrl+shift+NVDA+G. This works even when no password
list is loaded. A dialog will appear asking you to enter the length of
the password you'd like to generate. So far as I can tell, no known
limitation exists, and password generation times are very quick, even
for a one-million character password.</p>
